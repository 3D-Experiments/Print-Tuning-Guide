# Introduction

Much of this guide is specific to printers running **Klipper**. 

This guide was originally written for the Voron community, however all of the tuning instructions should work on **any Klipper printer**. Some of the bullet points and hardware troubleshooting tips are still Voron specific, however.

**:warning: Please pay special attention to anything bolded and marked with ":warning:"**

My SuperSlicer profiles are located [here](https://github.com/AndrewEllis93/Ellis-PIF-Profile).

You can find bed the models and textures I am using in [Hartk's GitHub repo](https://github.com/hartk1213/MISC/tree/main/Voron%20Mods/SuperSlicer). The bed texture I am using is an older one from him in [VoronUsers.](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/slicer_configurations/PrusaSlicer/hartk1213/V0/Bed_Shape) 

Thank you to **bythorsthunder** for help with testing these methods and providing some of the photos.
