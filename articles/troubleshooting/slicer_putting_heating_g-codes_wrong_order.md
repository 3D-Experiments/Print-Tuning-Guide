# Slicer is Putting Heating G-codes in the Wrong Place/Order
You have two options:
- Pass variables to `PRINT_START` (allows the most control, but is more complex)
    - See the *"Passing Variables to PRINT_START"* article [:page_facing_up:here](/articles/passing_slicer_variables.md).
- Force g-code ordering (only allows changing the g-code order, but is easy to set up)
    - See the *"Controlling G-code Order Without Passing Variables"* article [:page_facing_up:here](/articles/controlling_slicer_g-code_order.md).
