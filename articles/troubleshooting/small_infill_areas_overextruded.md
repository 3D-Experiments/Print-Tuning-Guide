# Small Infill Areas Look Overextruded

![](/images/troubleshooting/SmallAreas.png) 

- Some amount of this is unavoidable, but there are some things that *may* help:
    - Use single top perimeters (SuperSlicer). This simply makes these infill areas a bit larger.
    - Try reducing your pressure advance smooth time (I use 0.02)
    - Try reducing top infill speeds and accelerations.
