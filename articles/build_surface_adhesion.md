# Build Surface Adhesion
## All Surfaces
- **:warning:** Avoid touching your build surface as much as possible. Oils from your fingers will cause issues. Handle your spring steel with a clean rag or cloth.

- **:warning:** Ensure that your [:page_facing_up:first layer squish](/articles/first_layer_squish.md) is correct. 

- **:warning: Thoroughly wash all build plates with dish soap and water, followed by 70+% isopropyl alcohol.**
    - You should do this even for brand new surfaces.
    - Isopropyl alcohol does not do a great job of cleaning oils. It mostly just spreads them around.
    - I keep a spray bottle of soapy water next to my printer. Using a paper towel, I scrub with soapy water, then again with isopropyl alcohol (IPA).
    - Soap is not needed for every print. You can use IPA most of the time, with occasional soap when it needs further refreshing.


- User a proper first layer temperature.
    - PLA: ~60C
    - PETG: ~80C
    - ABS: ~90-100C*
        - *:warning: Voron V2 and Trident have a ~10-15C temperature drop due to the thickness of the bed. Most people run ~110C for ABS because of this.
    - Some filament brands recommend inaccurate/conservative temperatures. Try standard temps instead if you are having issues.

- Use adequately thick layer line widths. 
    - I use [:page_facing_up:**120%**](/articles/before_we_begin.md#a-note-about-line-width) normally, but higher line widths can further increase adhesion. 
        - Thicker widths create more pressure against the build surface, resulting in a better bond.

- Ensure your PEI is not counterfeit. You may have to ask in the Discord for others' experiences with a given brand. If your PEI is clear rather than yellowish, it's fake.
    - Stick to well-known brands. 
    - This is common with unknown AliExpress and Amazon sellers.
    - Ensure that the surface is actually meant for printing. Some plates *appear* to be two-sided (yellow/orange coloring for aesthetics) but are actually only one-sided.

- Instead of PEI (or to supplement your PEI), you can use adhesives like [:page_facing_up:Vision Miner Nano Polymer](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09JQWFVY3/ref=twister_B09JRGDWFT).
    - (Not sponsored) This stuff is excellent.
        - It grips like crazy. 
            - Though sometimes it grips *too* much. It can pull chunks out of glass or pull texture off of beds if too much is used.
        - It doesn't leave sticky residue (it does leave some slight whitish coloring though, which can be cleaned)
        - It's very thin and easy to spread with a brush.
        - It lasts a long time between applications.
        - It releases when cooled.



## Smooth PEI

- **Scuff it up** with a [:page_facing_up:kitchen scouring pad](https://www.scotch-brite.com/3M/en_US/scotch-brite/tools/~/Scotch-Brite-Heavy-Duty-Scour-Pad/?N=4337+3294529207+3294631680&rt=rud).

    - ~800-1000 grit sandpaper, or even the scrubby side of a fresh sponge may also work.
    - **This helps immensely**, much like how you would scuff/sand a surface before painting or gluing something to it.
    - You can refresh the surface this way on occasion, just remember to wash it again afterwards.


## Textured PEI

- Textured PEI often needs a little more squish than smooth PEI. This pushes the filament into the voids.

## P.S.
As a **very last resort**, you can try refreshing the surface with acetone. 

Keep in mind, however that 
 - :warning:This weakens PEI over time
 - :warning:It can **destroy** certain surfaces (mainly certain brands of textured sheets). 
 
 **Only try this if it's going in the trash otherwise.**
