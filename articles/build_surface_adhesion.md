# Build Surface Adhesion

- **:warning:** Avoid touching your build surface as much as possible. Oils from your fingers will cause issues. Handle your spring steel with a clean rag or cloth.

- **:warning:** Ensure that your [:page_facing_up:first layer squish](/articles/first_layer_squish.md) is correct. 

- **:warning: Thoroughly wash all build plates with dish soap and water, followed by 70+% isopropyl alcohol.**
    - You should do this even for brand new surfaces.
    - Isopropyl alcohol does not do a great job of cleaning oils. It mostly just spreads them around.
    - I keep a spray bottle of soapy water next to my printer. Using a paper towel, I scrub with soapy water, then again with isopropyl alcohol (IPA).
    - Soap is not needed for every print. You can use IPA most of the time, with occasional soap when it needs further refreshing.

- **Smooth PEI:**
    - **Scuff it up** with a [:page_facing_up:Scotch-Brite scouring pad](https://www.scotch-brite.com/3M/en_US/scotch-brite/tools/~/Scotch-Brite-Heavy-Duty-Scour-Pad/?N=4337+3294529207+3294631680&rt=rud).
        - The rough side of a fresh sponge, ~800-1000 grit sandpaper, or other brands of scouring pads could also work.
        - This helps immensely, much like how you would scuff/sand a surface before painting or gluing something to it.
        - You can refresh the surface this way on occasion, just remember to wash it again afterwards.
    - Ensure that you actually *have* smooth PEI. Some spring steels, particularly the reverse side of some textured steels, are yellow/orange in appearance but do not actually have PEI applied. Inspect the edges of the plate to verify.

- **Textured PEI:**
    - Needs more squish than smooth PEI, to push the filament into the cracks/dimples.

- Use thicker first layer line widths. 
    - I use 120% normally, but higher line widths can further increase adhesion. They push the plastic into the bed with more force, resulting in a better bond.

- Ensure your PEI is not counterfeit. You may have to ask in the Discord for others' experiences with a given brand. If your PEI is clear rather than yellowish, it's fake.
    - Stick to well-known brands. 
    - This is prevalent with unknown AliExpress and Amazon sellers.

- Instead of PEI (or to supplement your PEI), you can use adhesives like [:page_facing_up:Vision Miner Nano Polymer](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09JQWFVY3/ref=twister_B09JRGDWFT).
    - Not sponsored: I will praise this stuff until I am blue in the face. It's *excellent*.
        - It grips like crazy. 
            - Though sometimes it grips *too* much. It can pull chunks out of glass or pull texture off of beds if too much is used.
        - It doesn't leave sticky residue (it does leave some slight whitish coloring though, which can be cleaned)
        - It's very thin and easy to spread with a brush.
        - It lasts a long time between applications.
        - It releases when cooled.

- As a **very last resort**, you can try refreshing the surface with acetone. Keep in mind, however that this weakens PEI over time, and I heave heard cases of it **destroying** certain surfaces (mainly certain brands of textured sheets). **Only try this if it's going in the trash otherwise.**
